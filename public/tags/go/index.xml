      <description>The first step to deploying any app to Kubernetes, is to bundle the app in a container. There are several official, and community-backed container images for various languages and distros, and most of these containers can be really large, or sometimes contain overheads your app may never need/use.
Thanks to Docker, you can easily create container images in a few steps; specify a base image, add your app-specific changes, and build your container.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: In this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how easy it is to build a web application with Go and the Gin framework and add authentication to it. Check out the Github repo for the code we&amp;rsquo;re going to write.
 Gin is a high-performance micro-framework that delivers a very minimalistic framework that carries with it only the most essential features, libraries, and functionalities needed to build web applications and microservices. It makes it simple to build a request handling pipeline from modular, reusable pieces.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúGo will be the server language of the future.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäTobias L√ºtke, Shopify
 Go was first created as an experiment, the goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things.
Its first release was on March 2012. Go was designed to feel familiar and to stay as simple as possible, the entire language specification fits in just a few pages.</description>

      <description>Go is a relatively new programming language, and nothing makes a developer go crazier than a new programming language, haha! As many new tech inventions, Go was created as an experiment. The goal of its creators was to come up with a language that would resolve bad practices of others while keeping the good things. It was first released in March 2012. Since then Go has attracted many developers from all fields and disciplines.</description>
